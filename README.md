The app has to have backend and frontend (design architecture and technology chosen by candidate but also has to be able to speak about other known technologies). 

Minimalistic layout on the front end, minimum level GUI necessary to implement the features.

- app needs to be centered

- task type has to have a different color

- deadline red if it's only one day left and if it's not done

- sorting button has to indicate the way the tasks are sorted (name or icon)

- list name and user will be hard coded, no authentication/authorization

- input needs to be validated

Free choice of data storage. Entity relationship diagram has to be made
